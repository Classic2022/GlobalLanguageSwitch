We are very pleased about your interest in our company.

The use of our website is generally possible without providing any personal data. However, if a data subject wants to use special services offered by our company via the website, the processing of personal data might become necessary. If the processing of personal data is required and there is no legal basis for such processing, we generally obtain the consent of the data subject.

The processing of personal data—such as the name, address, email address, or telephone number of a data subject—is always carried out in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and in compliance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to us. With this privacy policy, our company would like to inform the public about the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use, and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed of their rights through this privacy policy.

As the controller responsible for processing, we have implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection possible of the personal data processed via this website. Nevertheless, internet-based data transmissions can generally have security gaps, so absolute protection cannot be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transmit personal data to us via alternative means, such as by telephone.
